In this repo we are going to work on Global Superstore Orders Data, which has more than 50,000 records with 21 unique features like Country, Product Category and Products etc.

This Superstore has operations all across the globe from North America to Asia Pacific, having hundreds of people working behind the scenes.These days management has been worried about certain performance indicators that they thing been declining over the years. So to validate business performance and represent it, I was assigned to the work.  I have used MS EXCEL as tool for data cleaning and Dashboard making.

## What management needs through the dashboard? ( Requirement gathering )
1.	What is year on year trend with Profit and Sales comprising all products in dollars?
2.	Which products are bringing most profits to superstore? Is product ranking changing YoY?
3.	What is profit contribution on global scale i.e by Region and Country? so that marketing campaign could be more concentrated around those parts.
4.	Sales and profit comparison with three categories Technology, Office supplies and Furniture.
5.	Show us % contribution in Sales and Profit with respect to the Categories.
6.	What is gross profit margin, Total products sold and Total orders made and incurred shipping costs YoY?
